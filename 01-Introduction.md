How to find objects with incorrect reference and therefore the memory that they are occupying cannot be reclaimed by the garbage collectors

- What is a garbage collector, what algorithm it uses to reclaim back the memory and how memories are organized in the v8 engine

- How to profile applications and take a memory snapshot

- How to compare snapshots, how to read them and actually find memory leaks

- How to write code that will not hide any memory leaks
